- generate in package of source
- apply to multiple
- generate enum of "lensabale" field
    - why?
- component annotation to add shortcut lens?
    - so `House(Address)` and `Person(@Direct House house)` => `PersonLens.ROOT.house().address`, but then also `PersonLens.ROOT.address()`
- also generate lombok-style with onto the lens?
    - so `PersonLens.ROOT.house().withAddress()` ?
- generate with methods so that lombok is not necessary
- remove vavr transitive dependency
