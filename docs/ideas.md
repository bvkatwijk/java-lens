# Backlog
- apply to multiple
  - array/varargs/collection types
    - vavr support?
- generate enum of "lensabale" field
    - why?
- component annotation to add shortcut lens?
    - so `House(Address)` and `Person(@Direct House house)` => `PersonLens.µ.house().address`, but then also `PersonLens.ROOT.address()`
- also generate lombok-style with onto the lens?
    - so `PersonLens.µ.house().withAddress()` ?
- generate with methods so that lombok is not necessary
  - maybe lombok add-on module?
- special lenses for java types
  - optional
  - map
  - collection
- maybe vavr add-on module?
